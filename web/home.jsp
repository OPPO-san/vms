            <div class="panel-body">Founded by two engineering classmates at Stanford University in 1993, I.D. Systems has 
                pioneered the use of RFID (radio frequency identification) technology for wireless vehicle management and fleet tracking.
                The initial success of I.D. Systems' emerging technology came in 1995, when the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) awarded the company
                a $6.6 million contract to develop and implement an innovative tracking system for monitoring the location and status of test
                letters and packages. By 1997, a demonstrated market need for fleet management and utilization led the company to develop a unique,
                patented technology that has application in a variety of corporate and government environments.
                I.D. Systems went public in 1999. Its shares trade under the symbol IDSY on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.</div>
